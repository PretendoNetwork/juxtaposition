This is a subset of minifill needed for Chromium 4.0.273.0 (AppleWebKit/532.7).
Lightly reformatted to get past our linter and modified to remove conditionals we don't need (since we know the exact target browser).

This folder has all the features that are missing, then index.js contains the subset which are actually used for the application.
